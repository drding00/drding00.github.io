// When the add name button is clicked, we should check to see if there is a localstorage item.
// If there isn't one, one should be made, and the first name added. 
// Else we should take the newly updated array of names and update the LS item. 

// When the winner button is clicked, we should retrieve the array from LS, and run the generator.
// When the generator is done, the selected name will be displayed.

// When the clear button is clicked, we should delete/clear everything in the LS.
