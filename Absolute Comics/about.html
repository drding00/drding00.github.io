           <p><strong>TLDR: It’s a comic book news and review live show hosted by former The Weekly Pull members Benny and Sal.</strong></p>

            <p>Still with us? Sweet! Here’s the full explanation: Absolute Comics aims to keep you, the comic book fan up to date with the latest industry news, book reviews, movies, shows, and other pop culture tidbits that you’re interested in, all wrapped up in a live weekly show over on Twitch. Each episode covers a multitude of topics hosted by Benny the Comicstorian and Sal from ComicPOP!, two founding members of the award winning podcast The Weekly Pull.</p>

            <p><strong>"So it’s really not The Weekly Pull?"</strong> Pretty much. However, like the mighty phoenix rising out of the ashes of its former self, Absolute Comics takes all the best things about TWP and condenses it into a streamlined and consistent show. And who doesn’t like consistency?</p>
            
            <p><strong>"But I fear change!"</strong> Worry not gentle viewer, we got awesome things in store for you including appearances from classic TWP crew members and special guests from the comic book industry!
