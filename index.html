 <p class="abouttext">The Wilson School was founded in 1909 by Rev. Henry B. Wilson and his wife, Teresa.  St. John’s School grew quickly to 13 grades, as there were few opportunities for girls to have an academic program in their high school years, and families wanted all of their children to attend school together.   In 1959 upon the retirement of Mrs. Wilson, who had been Head of School since her husband’s death in 1923, the school was dedicated and renamed The Wilson School.</p>
<p class="abouttext">When the School closed in 2013, The Wilson Foundation was created to offer students, educators and school programs the opportunity to apply for funds to help offset expenses needed for educational enrichment, whether in the form of tuition or extracurricular activities, such as study-travel programs, camps, college classes, etc.  Applicants are expected to procure matching funds.</p>
<p class="abouttext">The <a href="#application">application</a> for this fund is available and may be submitted at any time throughout the year.  Funds are allocated first to applicants having any relationship to St. John’s School, The Wilson School or St. John’s Episcopal Church, but not limited to them.</p>
